Overview

The plugin eui_vim concerns the use of a text editor as the user
interface to applications:  the "Editable User Interface".

It presents an alternative to incorporating applications into the
text editor as a tightly bound, monolithic product and to
resisting any integration of the text-editor with other
applications for non-text-editing functions.  

The conceptualization of the ''Editable User Interface'' helps
define and delimit the role of the text editor in facilitating the
use of diverse applications.  In such a role, the text editor is
delimited to being an interface only, i.e., in regard to support
of non-text-editing tasks, it is delimited to 

  * rendering user input,
  * transferring user commands and data to the external application,
  * responding to (text-editing) commands from the external application and
  * rendering the external application's output to the user.  

(In the above, rendering refers to display of text.)

As a specific example of the abstraction "Editable User Interface", 
the code presented here, eui_vim.vim and eui_vim.pl illustrate how 
one can use the Vim editor as an user interface to other applications.

Value

Most of the value of this plugin lies in the ideas expounded 
in eui_vim.txt or in http://www.sonic.net/~suresh/eui/ 
(and, perhaps, by way of the comments in the .vim and .pl code).
